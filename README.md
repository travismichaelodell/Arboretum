# Arboretum
Intelliegent organic application engine


Extension at Each Level:

1. core/base/berry.py (No change, but important to understand):

The Berry class provides the fundamental structure for all processes. It has a run method and handles jobs from the queue, and sends signals when completed. The new Berry will inherit from this.

2. core/base/shrub.py (No change, but important to understand):

The Shrub class manages collections of Berrys and their associated tasks, also ensuring threads have terminated and gracefully ends its executions of a child object. The new Berry will be managed by a Shrub.

3. core/base/trunk.py (No Change, used as a communication device with the entire project for web server comms and methods only, it's not changed, or used in the given extensions directly)

The trunk is used primarily as a main message queue that can translate the various modules between systems (in this specific instance, between the application itself, and outside web data sources or systems)

4. core/base/garden.py (No change needed as part of example):

Main system initializer that contains reference to system state.

Has core start and stopping methods for graceful close, loading system via local configurations for modular additions via different modules and their defined processes.

5. core/config/garden_config.json (Modify for loading new pot):
*Add the required parameters needed to load the CodeAnalysisModule so that it gets picked up by the garden initializer process with all other modules.

Explanation:

A new pot (code_analysis_pot) was added here.

It provides a file path to load its sub module and shrub, while adding it to the krr phylum. It has it's growth set to deep, so it automatically gets called in the initial system call (when starting up the ide and loading modules using it).

Python

Explanation:

Implements new processes within new module (CodeAnalysisModule). Creates CommentAnalyzerBerry that identifies and extracts all relevant comment lines in a code body passed by a ui request/signal from any caller, to perform an operation to that data then passes a result through the base Berry class method for all system state changes with it. It uses another model to add a result which acts like other analysis engines or ai, but is limited in this example scope

Implements core structure, setup to use a text analyzer for sentiments of local comments within software project for different ui display interactions.

Explanation:

Modified FusionIDE to include a "Analyze Comments" action to the editor_toolbar

Implemented logic in analyze_code_comments_from_text_selection to get current code block text based on selection and also calls new processes from code analysis module to a specified comment_analyzer. The code also hooks up the response signal with its on_code_analysis_complete_signal handler with text output, or displays an error message if the code analyzer did not resolve successfully or returns an empty data block as a processing result (a required process if system did not function as desired/intended to provide a safe application). All error handling in UI MUST BE using local context calls with an associated try...except block at method call to prevent failures in other process and a consistent response on actions for state management.

8. ide/components/code_editor.py (no changes are needed as it operates on specific file type content that this demo does not interact with currently for custom functionality or events, beyond setting base properties)

It's purpose here is as a simple test, that implements its features using the existing QtWidget, QTextEdit functionality which uses other helper classes/methods like local formatting.py to display or change string attributes in that given block or UI window instance, where necessary. (More complex IDE objects have different functionality that is available but will not be expanded here in this demonstration as these functionalities go above requirements/scope.)

9. ide/utils/formatting.py(No changes):

The functions provided (generate_embedding, format_code) in this particular helper are used in other modules to ensure consistency for local/external use data formatting that are used by all aspects of the code where needed and are useful as methods across different modules without hard dependencies. (in real application this will have methods used for formatting data from various sources as string values that the app/llm requires in order to reduce coupling for specific module functionality dependencies)

10. ide/dialogs/settings_dialog.py(No changes needed as part of current scope)

Allows system settings and configurations with local save. Can also set and modify local values to core configurations if it required it with a settings model.

11. ide/components/file_explorer.py: (no change needed here since no requirements currently exist that relate to specific changes for file processing, therefore does not modify object state in current testing)

Helper component that implements methods for retrieving, managing local state of selected files, and parsing text content, or providing basic actions to it based on context from clicks.

12. ide/components/project_tree.py: (no change since we only get filepaths, we don't change contents, and so do not need access to other properties than the ones that we have specified from local path.)

13. ide/components/status_bar.py: (No change)

14. ide/managers/project_manager.py(No changes needed):

Maintains and manages different application parameters specific to project data or local machine details that can persist between project sessions or specific program loads of the IDE. It stores configurations, current code states, and general data that requires external calls for complex processing/logic with state of program and local information and configuration settings specific to loaded state. Used also as interface layer for different processes within IDE or used in core system. (like for a large data analysis or if api access is desired.)

15. ide/managers/debugger.py(No changes needed since we do not require access or change of local debugger for current demo):

Tool specific for processing specific files by creating sub process and manages any information retrieval from api related requests used to test core code files.

16. ide/managers/chat_manager.py: (No changes are necessary for new additions, but serves the same design as above):

Is built, in example context here, to handle chats within a UI view. Future usage would be similar and have some data persistance if required or other more useful logic associated.

Explanation of the System:

Modular Design: The system is designed in a modular way. Core functionalities and base classes for each category of implementations, with core objects used to manage UI, systems (like knowledge system, external services etc.) have their own *.py that have implementations relating to it. Core classes always extends a specific module or base level classes that ensures an initial consistent context for that component.

UI Integration with Core Logic: When specific UI is acted upon it emits an event. The object that triggers action, such as a button on a panel emits signal, it will get that component state of its data that it needs at that point to perform some method. The main IDE class implements code that triggers the specific Berry in associated Shrub/Module in a way to act on UI event (like a clicked button action with parameters related to that process), through their exposed methods (using the decorator Shrub.expose_leaf()). If response of specific module is needed UI main thread logic receives a signal response through the specified berry.job_complete.connect(method) callback pattern that it created when executing an individual task/request that the user called within it's context of a parent's Shurb object using an add_job() method call on that specific module.

Data Flow: All actions trigger state changes of object local states for given method calls and parameters that were defined on those modules in those particular components. All interprocess communications happen either within a Queue context or with thread or signal management so threads do not write to same shared variables without the lock mechanism by the queue, this is what the design patterns promote when objects are extended using signal based approaches where state is shared or changed by data retrieved or transformed. No modules should write data states (such as local arrays, dictionaries etc) in modules from code within threads. In addition each component is created with its parent for proper resource handling using Qt UI mechanics. All resources can be freed up during garbage collection by a proper parent child reference during the initialization and lifecycle of their parent UI or system object components. The design also shows (with various classes like fileExplorer), that if one needs the system level states like, a loaded configuration to be present for access within a component, you would include the methods and the system state with the implementation of a manager class (such as ProjectManager) then it will inherit that capability or have local logic when this object exists in various object context, using same type of core structure that is followed by the rest of the applications modular pattern. The objects themselves (such as various text areas with file selection), are components that will take input then it will provide output based on the object, it can not directly request anything, and most interactions from data or actions must be received using callback method signals when using threads, with Qt context. Any data passing across components will also be as serialized string based dictionary for state consistency across all UI and process objects so object states remain as serialized values instead of class specific instances, such as strings, dictionaries and booleans so if changes/updates have been created in the system the core system can still execute the process regardless if an object is misformed since it would expect all data from all actions to always conform with generic string and or boolean type requirements. In this case the Berry responses and data types are generally string, boolean or a dictionay of string key, object data (or simple array, that acts on QListWidget like values), this design would maintain thread safety and prevent ui updates from different context or thread clashes. Also when a signal is used (all data flow) must pass the entire object because some processing might require reference, the signal object must then be unpacked from parameters within. This would also include various metadata or data that describes type, as object state must also remain persistent if processing needs it at a later stage from an initial event source.

How LLMs Should Use This Example:

Understand the Core: LLMs should grasp the purpose of each base class (Berry, Shrub, Trunk, Garden).

Modules & Structure: They should understand the structure by file organization. and that any new addition should have this type of local, modular context.

Signals/Slots: Must create communication using this signal/slot for ui
